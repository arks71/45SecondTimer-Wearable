# 45SecondTimer-Wearable
A wearable version of a 45 second timer designed for roller hockey referees based on the BBC micro:bit

Uses the BBC micro:bit radio to communicate with other micro:bits so multiple referees can share the timer.

The radio channel number is configurable in the source as you might want to avoid malicious interference.

The BBC micro:bit watch kit from Cool Components is a suitable souce of the components https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/micro-bit-watch-kit (but don't forget to make sure you have CR2025 batteries for this one).
